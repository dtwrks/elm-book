{-| This module focuses on actions – a.k.a messages your book may send to its runtime. There are mainly two types of actions:

  - **log actions** will not deal with any state. They will just print out some message to the action logger. This is pretty useful to get things running quickly.
  - **update actions** are used to update your book's shared state. A bit trickier to use but you can do a lot more powerful things with it.


# Logging Actions

Take a look at the ["Logging Actions"](https://elm-book-in-elm-book.netlify.app/guides/logging-actions) guide for some examples.

**Tip** If you want to test anchor elements without actually changing the current url, just pass in an url like `/logAction/some-url`. Your book will intercept any url change starting with `/logAction` and will log the action intent.

@docs logAction, logActionWithString, logActionWithBool, logActionWithInt, logActionWithFloat, logActionWith


# Updating Actions

**Tip:** I highly recommend you read the ["Stateful Chapters"](https://elm-book-in-elm-book.netlify.app/guides/logging-actions) guide to learn more about update actions and stateful chapters.
